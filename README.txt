Part A features a cat with the Tron Filter on it. The bright outline around the cat glows by way of a bloom filter.
However, this bloom does not work in WebGL and a screenshot showing that it works is included in the repository.
The cat can also be seen through other objects having added a x ray pass to the shader.

Part B is an environment with water that both reflects the given cube map as well as refracts all objects that
are underwater.
